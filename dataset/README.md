## Problem Description

You are the “Assistant-Academic-Report-Generation-In-Charge” at NITK.
Well, Assistant to the Academic Report Generation In Charge, but they
are the same as you will see. 

Your job responsibilities are simple: Gather excel sheets with marks
from different faculties, generate statistical reports to identify
cutoffs (and confirm cutoffs with faculty), assign grades for each
student in each course, and then finally, calculate the cumulative and
semester GPAs.

The process is manual, labor-intensive, and as impressive as it sounds. 

With the new season of IPL starts, you wonder if you can still pursue
your childhood dream: being a [professional ball man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujinFRRU61w).
If only there were a way you can spend less time dealing with snobby kids :P
